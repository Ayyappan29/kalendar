kalendar
========

Revamped version of my flat_calendar plugin. Now offers more features and easier customization.  
Supports both custom and Google Calendar events. 

Supported customizations include:  
* __First day of the week__ — Default is monday but could be any day of the month
* __Toggle daylabel__
* __Starting month/year__ — Decide which month you would like to display from start
* __Color__

Usage
-------

kalendar can be initialized with both pure HTML and JS. Personally I prefer JS because it gives you a better overview of the options. But you are free to use whatever you’d like. Obviously.

First of all though, you have to import the .css and .js file to your project.

### initialize with JS

#### Simple kalendar

```javascript
jQuery(".kalendar-element").kalendar();	
```
